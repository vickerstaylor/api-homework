# API Homework Analysis
Here are the 3 observable trends found during my analysis:
  1. From the "City Latitude vs. Max Temperature (07/18/19)" chart, the closer the city is to the Equator the higher the max temperature.
  2. From the "City Latitude vs. Wind Speed (07/18/19)" chart, higher wind speeds tend to group up the closer you get to the North Pole.
  3. From the "City Latitude vs. Humidity (07/18/19)" chart, the largest concentration of higher humidity appears to be in cities closer to the Equator, but there is also another concentration the closer you get to the North Pole.
